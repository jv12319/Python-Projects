# Python-Projects
Purpose: In VsCode, I created a Python project which produces an interactive terminal that allows users to create, read, update, and delete expenses from a table. My intent with this project was to create a simple database which holds an expense table that the user can add and modify information in via the terminal.

Languages and tools: For this project I used Python, SQL and MySQL workbench, I also used the mysql.connector driver so I could execute SQL commands inside a Python file.
